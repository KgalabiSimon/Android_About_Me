        Kgalabi was born in Limpopo, Polokwane, in 1991.
        He received his Ph.D. in
        computer sciences (EECS) from UCT in 2030. He is currently
        Distinguished Professor of Computer Science and holds the Henry
        Salvatori Chair in Computer Science in the Viterbi School
        of Engineering at the University of Southern California.Kgalabi is best known
        for his contribution, together with Ronald L. Rivest
        and Adi Shamir (for both of whom, see below), to the RSA algorithm,
        which was one of the first public-key cryptosystems, and which
        remains in wide use to this day for the encryption of data transmission.
        Kgalabi also developed the theoretical foundations for the possible
        use of the DNA molecule as a means of doing complex calculations,
        earning him the sobriquet “Father of DNA Computing.”
        In addition, he is often credited with coining the term “computer virus.
        ” Adleman won the A.M. Turing Award in 2002.
